<p>Key Components of a Graphics Card
    GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):<br>
    <br>
    
    The core of the graphics card, responsible for all the calculations needed to render images.
    Modern GPUs have thousands of cores to handle parallel processing tasks efficiently.<br>
    Memory (VRAM):<br>
    
    Dedicated memory used by the GPU to store image data and textures.<br>
    The amount and speed of VRAM significantly impact the performance of the graphics card.<br>
    <br>
    VRM (Voltage Regulator Module):<br>
    <br>
    Ensures that the GPU and memory receive a stable and adequate power supply.<br>
    Critical for maintaining performance and preventing hardware damage.<br>
    <br>
    Cooling Solutions:<br>
    <br>
    Includes fans, heatsinks, and sometimes liquid cooling systems to dissipate heat generated by the GPU.<br>
    Effective cooling is essential for maintaining performance and preventing overheating.<br>
    <br>
    Connectors:<br>
    <br>
    Various output connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA) to connect the graphics card to monitors and other display devices.
    Power connectors (6-pin, 8-pin) to supply additional power from the PSU (Power Supply Unit).</p>
